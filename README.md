# Connect

**Facing some problem in uploading other files. Will do it as soon as possible**

Connect is a platform by which we want to connect people of IIT Mandi together through means of their interests, projects and expertise.  It happens that a person gets interested in some area/technology and starts to learn more about it from the resources on hand, most of the times it being the internet. Searching for specific doubts takes time which could have been avoided if he/she knew a friend or a senior close to him/her. Some of us know about our friends or seniors working on the same area on which we are interested. The rest are not so lucky.  Connect provides a platform through which Students and even professors of IIT Mandi can put the topics and areas on which they have worked on and how much they know about that particular topic.
This web app is build using **Flask.** It was built during Hackathon 2K18 @IIT Mandi.
